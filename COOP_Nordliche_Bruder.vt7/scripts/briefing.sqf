"Tag Soldaten several days ago several Russian mechanized division crossed the border into Finland and have been running rampant around the region the Finnish Defense Force cannot stop this unit in particular as they have heavy MLRS artillery and T-90A MBTs. 
As such they have enlisted the help of the Bundeswehr to help take out this unit. 
While we were supposed to get leopard 2A6 tanks in true German fashion all their transmissions broke while trying to drive here from Helsinki as such our only heavy anti-armor asset will be the Grayhawk drone so our JTACs better be good at their job.<br/>
